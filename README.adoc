# New Project Script
:author: Duncan Lock

Script for creating/scaffolding new personal projects.

## Requirements

You need `git` installed. See: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git

For Debian/Ubuntu, you can do:

```shell
$ sudo apt install git
```

For public projects (the `--public` flag), creating the GitHub repo requires `gh` to be installed & setup - see https://cli.github.com/

## Installation

```shell
$ sudo cp new-project.sh /usr/bin/new-project
```

## Usage

Create a new project called "test project"

```shell
$ new-project.sh test project
```
  
Create a new public project called "test project"

```shell
$ new-project.sh --public test project
```
